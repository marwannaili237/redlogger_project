    # --- BEST APPROACH: Use a pre-built Docker image for Buildozer ---
    container: kivy/buildozer:latest # This image contains Python, Java, Android SDK/NDK, and Buildozer pre-configured

    steps:

    # All these steps are now handled by the 'container' image:
    # - name: Set up Python
    # - name: Set up Java
    # - name: Install system dependencies
    # - name: Install Python dependencies
    # - name: Manually install Android SDK cmdline-tools
